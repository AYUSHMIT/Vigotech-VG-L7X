# Welcome to the Vigotech VG-L7X wiki!
This Wiki was created to talk about Vigotech VG-L7X (WiFi) engraver protocol.

Vigotech made some design choices that make this machine usable ONLY with their VigoWorks software. This means that if you buy this machine you will not be able to use it with other programs that use the GRBL standard (like [LaserGRBL](https://lasergrbl.com), LightBurn, T2Laser, etc).

Luckily for you, an alternative firmware has been written! 
With this firmware flashed on the ESP32 chip you can use LaserGRBL and all these programs, instead of the inconvenient software supplied!

This pictures can help you understand what is the difference between a standard/common GRBL controller board, and Vigo L7X board:
